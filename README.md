## 🔧 Technical Details

### Architecture

The application consists of:

## 🔍 Advanced Features

### Auto-Refreshing Debug Page

The debug page automatically refreshes every 5 seconds to show:

- System information (OS, Python version, memory usage)
- Live list of downloaded files with thumbnails
- Environment variables
- Container status
- Pagination for large file collections

You can toggle auto-refresh, manually refresh, or view file details directly from this interface.

### Live Log Viewer

The logs page provides real-time monitoring capabilities:

- Color-coded log levels for better readability
- Filtering by log level (INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
- Full-text search functionality
- Auto-scroll to latest entries
- Manual and automatic refresh options
- Proper line wrapping for long log entries

### Template Inheritance

The application uses Flask's Jinja2 template inheritance for consistent UI across all pages:

- Base layout template (`layout.html`) defines the overall page structure
- Page-specific templates extend the base layout and inject content
- Header and footer components are included consistently across all pages
- Each page can add its own custom scripts and styles when needed

### Configuration System

The application uses a flexible JSON-based configuration system:

- User-editable `config.json` file for customizing application settings
- Default configuration provided if no config file exists
- Separate logging configuration for different components
- Easily extensible for new features and settings

## 📊 Logging Configuration

The application provides flexible logging configuration through environment variables:

### Environment Variables

You can control the verbosity of logs in different outputs by setting these environment variables in your `compose.yaml` file:

- `CONSOLE_LOG_LEVEL`: Controls logging level for console output (default: `DEBUG`)
- `FILE_LOG_LEVEL`: Controls logging level for file output (default: `DEBUG`)
- `WERKZEUG_LOG_LEVEL`: Controls Flask's web server logging (default: `INFO`)
- `USE_LOG_FILTERS`: When set to `true`, enables component-specific log filtering (default: `false`)

### Available Log Levels

From most to least verbose:
- `DEBUG`: All messages including detailed diagnostics
- `INFO`: General operational information
- `WARNING`: Issues that might need attention but don't affect operation
- `ERROR`: Errors that prevent specific operations
- `CRITICAL`: Critical errors that prevent application functioning

### Log Files

The application maintains several log files:
- `app.log`: Main application log
- `downloads.log`: Download-specific logs
- `errors.log`: Error-only logs
- `debug.log`: Debug-level logs

### Example Configuration

To reduce console output while maintaining detailed file logs:

```yaml
environment:
  - CONSOLE_LOG_LEVEL=INFO
  - FILE_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
  - WERKZEUG_LOG_LEVEL=WARNING
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Debug and Logs Pages

The application includes two helpful pages for debugging:

- **Debug Page**: Shows system information, downloaded files with thumbnails, and environment variables
  - Access at: `http://localhost:5000/debug`
  - Provides pagination for large file collections

- **Logs Page**: Shows detailed application logs right in your browser
  - Access at: `http://localhost:5000/logs`
  - Logs are color-coded by level (INFO, DEBUG, WARNING, ERROR)
  - Properly wraps long log lines for better readability

### Common Issues

1. **Media not downloading**:
   - Check if the downloads directory has proper permissions
   - Ensure the container has write access to the volume
   - Look at the logs for detailed errors

2. **Viewing logs**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs -f discord_downloader
   ```

3. **Testing downloads directly**:
   ```bash
   # From inside the container
   docker exec -it discord_downloader python -m utils.test_download https://example.com/image.jpg
   ```

4. **Manual volume permission fix**:
   ```bash
   docker exec -it discord_downloader chmod -R 777 /app/downloads
   ```

## 🔄 Alternative Deployment Options

### Using Uvicorn (ASGI)

If you prefer using Uvicorn instead of the default Flask server:

1. Add `uvicorn` to requirements.txt:
```
flask==2.3.3
requests==2.31.0
uvicorn==0.23.2
psutil==5.9.5
Pillow==10.0.0
```

2. Modify the Dockerfile CMD:
```dockerfile
CMD ["uvicorn", "app:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "5000"]
```
